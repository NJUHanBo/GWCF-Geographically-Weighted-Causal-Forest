Package: gwcf
Title: Geographically Weighted Causal Forest
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Bo", "Han", email = "bh613@cam.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements a geographically weighted causal forest framework for estimating
    spatially varying heterogeneous treatment effects. The package combines causal forests
    (Athey et al., 2019) with kernel-weighted spatial averaging to address validation leakage
    and variance underestimation in spatial data.
